# FreeInk SDK

A hardware-independent SDK for building e-paper reader firmware. FreeInk
abstracts every device-specific detail — display controller, waveforms/LUTs,
GPIOs, bus speeds, input style, touch, frontlight, audio — behind small,
injectable interfaces, so the firmware calls one generic API and gets
device-specific behavior. Adding a new device means adding data (a board
profile + a driver config), not editing the generic code.

It is **drop-in compatible** with firmware written against the original
`EInkDisplay` / `InputManager` / `BatteryMonitor` / `SDCardManager` / `BoardConfig`
API: switching to FreeInk is a matter of repointing the library path.

## Credit & lineage

FreeInk is an independent, clean-room reorganization **based on** the work of
the **OpenX4 E-Paper Community SDK** (`open-x4-epaper/community-sdk`, MIT) and its
contributors — in particular **CidVonHighwind** for the original `EInkDisplay`
driver and the X3/X4 waveform work, and the community device ports (M5Stack
PaperColor, Murphy M3, and the `community-sdk-de-link` ESP32-S3 port). The
register sequences and waveform LUTs for the SSD1677 and UC8253 panels are
derived from that project. Huge thanks to everyone who reverse-engineered and
tuned those panels.

FreeInk is **not a fork** and has no build-time or runtime dependency on the
upstream repository — it has its own history and its own architecture. Where the
upstream interleaved every device in one monolithic driver, FreeInk splits each
controller into a standalone, compile-time-selectable driver behind a stable
facade.

## Architecture

```
firmware  ─calls─▶  EInkDisplay  (alias of freeink::FreeInkDisplay, the facade)
                          │ owns framebuffer + geometry, selects a driver at begin()
                          ▼
                    PanelDriver  (interface)
              ┌───────────┼───────────────┬───────────────┐
        Ssd1677Driver  Uc8253X3Driver  Ed2208M5Driver  Uc8253MurphyDriver
         (X4/de-link)     (X3)          (M5, stub)       (Murphy, stub)
                          │  all share
                          ▼
                       EpdBus  (SPI/GPIO framing, BUSY polarity, reset, mirror)
```

- **`FreeInkDisplay`** (facade, exposed as `EInkDisplay`) owns the framebuffer(s)
  and geometry and delegates every panel operation to a `PanelDriver`. It
  preserves the full public API, including the `FULL_REFRESH` / `HALF_REFRESH` /
  `FAST_REFRESH` modes and the grayscale / anti-aliased dual-plane path
  (`copyGrayscaleBuffers` → `displayGrayBuffer`, `writeGrayscalePlaneStrip`).
- **`PanelDriver`** — one implementation per controller, in its own file. Each
  driver owns its register sequences and cross-call state, and takes its
  waveforms/LUTs/tunables as an injected **config** (e.g. `Ssd1677Config`,
  `Uc8253X3Config`) so per-device tuning is data, not code.
- **`EpdBus`** — shared SPI/GPIO helper, parameterized by SPI clock and BUSY
  polarity (per-controller default, board-overridable via
  `BoardConfig::ACTIVE.displaySpiHz`).
- **`BoardConfig`** — the one compile-time-selected description of a device:
  pins, geometry, controller, input style, touch, frontlight, audio.

### Nothing device-specific is hardcoded in generic code

GPIOs come from the `EInkDisplay` constructor (firmware passes
`BoardConfig::ACTIVE.display.*`) and from `BoardConfig`. SPI clocks have a
controller default and a board override. Waveforms/LUTs, booster values, scan
direction, and refresh temperatures are injected via the driver config struct. A
new device fills in values; the generic driver consumes them.

## Supported devices

| Device | MCU | Controller | Panel | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Xteink X4** | ESP32-C3 | SSD1677 | 800×480 B/W + 4-level gray | ✅ full |
| **Xteink X3** | ESP32-C3 | UC8253 | 792×528 B/W + 4-level gray | ✅ full (runtime-selected) |
| **de-link** | ESP32-S3 | SSD1677 | 800×480 B/W + gray, frontlight | ✅ full (SD over SPI; 4-bit SDMMC is a follow-up) |
| **M5Stack PaperColor** | ESP32-S3 | ED2208 | 400×600 color | 🟡 driver stub + abstraction |
| **Murphy M3** | ESP32-S3 | UC8253 | 240×416 B/W, CHSC6x touch, PWM frontlight | 🟡 driver stub + abstraction |

X3 and X4 share the ESP32-C3 and one pin profile, so **a single firmware binary
drives both** — the panel is chosen at runtime via `setDisplayX3()`. Distinct-MCU
boards (S3) build their own binary, selected with a board macro.

## Build flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Generic Xteink C3 build: links **SSD1677 + UC8253-X3**, runtime-selected |
| `-DBOARD_DELINK` | de-link ESP32-S3 profile (SSD1677 + frontlight) |
| `-DBOARD_M5STACK_PAPERCOLOR` | M5Stack PaperColor profile (ED2208) |
| `-DBOARD_MURPHY_M3` | Murphy M3 profile (UC8253 + touch + frontlight) |
| `-DFREEINK_DISPLAY_FLIPPED` (or `-DFLIPPED`) | Vertically flip an SSD1677 panel |
| `-DEINK_DISPLAY_SINGLE_BUFFER_MODE=1` | Single framebuffer (uses controller RAM as previous frame) |
| `-DFREEINK_DRIVER_SSD1677` / `_UC8253_X3` / `_ED2208` / `_UC8253_MURPHY` | Force a specific driver into the link set |
| `-DFREEINK_NET_WOLFSSL=1` | Enable the wolfSSL TLS 1.3 transport in `SecureNet` |

## Networking — TLS 1.3 (`SecureNet`)

The precompiled mbedTLS in the ESP-IDF/pioarduino package ships TLS 1.3 as empty
stubs, so `WiFiClientSecure` / `esp_http_client` cannot reach TLS-1.3-only servers
(e.g. KOSync at `kosync.ak-team.com:3042` — handshake fails with `-0x7780`). A
`-D` flag can't change a precompiled `.a`, and a from-source ESP-IDF rebuild is a
heavier path. `SecureNet` brings its own TLS stack — **wolfSSL compiled from
source** — which supports TLS 1.3 + PSA and bypasses system mbedTLS entirely:

- `freeink::SecureClient` — an Arduino `Client` doing TLS 1.3 over `WiFiClient`.
- `freeink::SecureHttpClient` — an `HTTPClient`-compatible shim so existing call
  sites switch with minimal churn.

Opt-in: `-DFREEINK_NET_WOLFSSL=1` plus a wolfSSL source `lib_dep`. With the flag
off it compiles to an inert stub, so the rest of the SDK builds without wolfSSL.

## Using FreeInk from PlatformIO

Add the libraries you need as symlink `lib_deps` (names match the original SDK):

```ini
lib_deps =
  BoardConfig=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/BoardConfig
  EInkDisplay=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/display/FreeInkDisplay
  InputManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/InputManager
  BatteryMonitor=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/BatteryMonitor
  SDCardManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/SDCardManager
  ; optional:
  FrontlightManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/FrontlightManager
  SecureNet=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/network/SecureNet
```

`#include <EInkDisplay.h>` and the `EInkDisplay` type keep working via the compat
shim. The display lib needs `BoardConfig` and `SdFat` (provided by the consuming
project, as before).

## Adding a new device

1. Add a `BoardProfile` to `BoardConfig.h` (pins, geometry, controller, input
   style, optional touch/frontlight/audio) and a board macro for `ACTIVE`.
2. If it uses an existing controller, reuse that driver — supply a tuned config
   struct (its own LUTs/voltages) if the panel differs. If it's a new
   controller, add a `PanelDriver` in its own file + a `FREEINK_DRIVER_*` flag.
3. Same-MCU boards can join the generic multi-driver binary; different-MCU boards
   get their own build env.

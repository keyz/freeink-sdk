# FreeInk SDK

A hardware-independent SDK for building e-paper reader firmware. FreeInk
abstracts every device-specific detail — display controller, waveforms/LUTs,
GPIOs, bus speeds, input style, touch, frontlight, audio — behind small,
injectable interfaces, so the firmware calls one generic API and gets
device-specific behavior. Adding a new device means adding data (a board
profile + a driver config), not editing the generic code.

It is **drop-in compatible** with firmware written against the original
`EInkDisplay` / `InputManager` / `BatteryMonitor` / `SDCardManager` / `BoardConfig`
API: switching to FreeInk is a matter of repointing the library path.

## Credit & lineage

FreeInk is an independent, clean-room reorganization **based on** the work of
the **OpenX4 E-Paper Community SDK** (`open-x4-epaper/community-sdk`, MIT) and its
contributors — in particular **CidVonHighwind** for the original `EInkDisplay`
driver and the X3/X4 waveform work, and the community device ports (M5Stack
PaperColor, Murphy M3, and the `community-sdk-de-link` ESP32-S3 port). The
register sequences and waveform LUTs for the SSD1677 and UC8253 panels are
derived from that project. Huge thanks to everyone who reverse-engineered and
tuned those panels.

FreeInk is **not a fork** and has no build-time or runtime dependency on the
upstream repository — it has its own history and its own architecture. Where the
upstream interleaved every device in one monolithic driver, FreeInk splits each
controller into a standalone, compile-time-selectable driver behind a stable
facade.

## Architecture

```
firmware  ─calls─▶  EInkDisplay  (alias of freeink::FreeInkDisplay, the facade)
                          │ owns framebuffer + geometry, selects a driver at begin()
                          ▼
                    PanelDriver  (interface)
              ┌───────────┼───────────────┬───────────────┐
        Ssd1677Driver  Uc8253X3Driver  Ed2208M5Driver  Uc8253MurphyDriver
         (X4/de-link)     (X3)            (M5)            (Murphy)
                          │  native controllers share
                          ▼
                       EpdBus  (SPI/GPIO framing, BUSY polarity, reset, mirror)

  External-library drivers (M5OfficialDriver, LgfxEpdDriver/LilyGo) own their own
  bus and report usesExternalBus(), so the facade leaves EpdBus down.
```

- **`FreeInkDisplay`** (facade, exposed as `EInkDisplay`) owns the framebuffer(s)
  and geometry and delegates every panel operation to a `PanelDriver`. It
  preserves the full public API, including the `FULL_REFRESH` / `HALF_REFRESH` /
  `FAST_REFRESH` modes and the grayscale / anti-aliased dual-plane path
  (`copyGrayscaleBuffers` → `displayGrayBuffer`, `writeGrayscalePlaneStrip`).
- **`PanelDriver`** — one implementation per controller, in its own file. Each
  driver owns its register sequences and cross-call state, and takes its
  waveforms/LUTs/tunables as an injected **config** (e.g. `Ssd1677Config`,
  `Uc8253X3Config`) so per-device tuning is data, not code.
- **`EpdBus`** — shared SPI/GPIO helper, parameterized by SPI clock and BUSY
  polarity (per-controller default, board-overridable via
  `BoardConfig::ACTIVE.displaySpiHz`).
- **`BoardConfig`** — the one compile-time-selected description of a device:
  pins, geometry, controller, input style, touch, frontlight, audio.

### Nothing device-specific is hardcoded in generic code

GPIOs come from the `EInkDisplay` constructor (firmware passes
`BoardConfig::ACTIVE.display.*`) and from `BoardConfig`. SPI clocks have a
controller default and a board override. Waveforms/LUTs, booster values, scan
direction, and refresh temperatures are injected via the driver config struct. A
new device fills in values; the generic driver consumes them.

Device *names* and `FREEINK_DEVICE_*` flags live **only** in `BoardConfig` (the
registry), which derives `FREEINK_DRIVER_*` / `FREEINK_CAP_*` from them. Feature
files — facade, drivers, input, SD — key only off those derived flags and injected
config/hooks, never a device name. Board quirks that aren't plain config (e.g. an
SD rail behind an I²C PMIC) come in through hooks like `SDCardManager::setPowerHook()`,
so the SD manager itself stays device-agnostic.

## Supported devices

| Device | MCU | Controller | Panel | FreeInk support |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Xteink X4** | ESP32-C3 | SSD1677 | 800×480 | B/W + 4-level grayscale |
| **Xteink X3** | ESP32-C3 | UC8253 | 792×528 | B/W + 4-level grayscale; BQ27220 I²C battery gauge; shares the C3 binary with X4 |
| **de-link** | ESP32-S3 | SSD1677 | 800×480 | B/W + grayscale, PWM frontlight, native 4-bit SDMMC SD |
| **M5Stack PaperColor** | ESP32-S3 | ED2208 | 400×600 Spectra-6 color | native interrupted-refresh driver, optional M5GFX backend |
| **Murphy M3** | ESP32-S3 | UC8253 | 240×416 | B/W (90°-rotated framebuffer, full/fast LUTs), CHSC6x touch, PWM frontlight |
| **LilyGo T5 S3** | ESP32-S3 | ED047TC1 (raw parallel) | 960×540 16-gray | LovyanGFX EPD driver with 16-gray, GT911 touch, PWM backlight, BQ27220/BQ25896 I²C battery |

X3 and X4 share the ESP32-C3 and a pinout, so **one firmware binary drives both**:
it carries both board profiles (`XTEINK_X4` and `XTEINK_X3`) and picks one at
runtime via `setDisplayX3()`, which swaps the active profile and driver. Each
distinct-MCU board (S3) builds its own binary, selected with a `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_*`
flag.

Every SDK library compiles on both ESP32-C3 and ESP32-S3. Chip-specific code in a
consumer's *own* layer (deep-sleep wakeup, panic backtrace, flash pins) can block a
multi-MCU build; [`docs/consumer-mcu-portability.md`](docs/consumer-mcu-portability.md)
covers the changes a consumer makes.

### M5Stack PaperColor refresh behavior

The PaperColor is natively a **six-color (Spectra 6), full-refresh** panel: a
complete OTP waveform takes **~15 s** — unusable for reading. To get
reading-compatible speeds, FreeInk's native driver **interrupts the refresh at
~340 ms**. The colors settle in order with **white settling last**, so cutting
off early leaves the panel **black or yellow** (depending on the inversion /
polarity selected) rather than white — and FreeInk exploits that to produce a
fast, high-contrast monochrome image. A true white background / full color
requires running the complete waveform (`requestCompleteWaveformNextRefresh()`).

Two backends are selectable for this device:
- **Native ED2208 (default)** — the fast interrupted-refresh path above.
- **M5 official (`-DFREEINK_M5_OFFICIAL=1`)** — wraps M5's own **M5Unified + M5GFX**
  stack for users who prefer the vendor path (slower, but standard). This pulls
  the M5 libraries only on that env; M5GFX owns the bus (`usesExternalBus()`).

**Capacitive touch** (gated by `FREEINK_CAP_TOUCH`) covers two controllers:
**CHSC6x** (Murphy M3 — IRQ-driven) and **GT911** (LilyGo — polled, raw register
reads + the reset/address dance). The InputManager exposes `hasTouch/isTouchPressed/
wasTouchPressed/wasTouchReleased/getTouchPoint`; it delivers coordinates
raw-panel-oriented and the app owns rotation. The LilyGo T5 S3 profile uses the
GT911 config (`BoardConfig::LILYGO_T5_PRO_GT911`) alongside its raw-parallel EPD
driver (`LgfxEpdDriver`, see below).

## Build composition — devices × capabilities

A build is composed along two axes.

**Devices** (`-DFREEINK_DEVICE_<NAME>`) declare which hardware the binary supports.
Each device pulls in its panel driver, adds its board profile to the runtime
registry, and turns on its default capabilities. Compose any set that shares an
MCU (a C3-vs-S3 mix is a compile error):

| Pass | Result |
|---|---|
| `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_X4` | X4 only — links just SSD1677 (tightest) |
| `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_X3 -DFREEINK_DEVICE_X4` | X3 **and** X4 in one C3 binary, runtime-selected via `setDisplayX3()` |
| `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_DELINK` | de-link (S3, SSD1677 + frontlight) |
| `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_M5` | M5 PaperColor (S3, ED2208 + color) |
| `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_MURPHY` | Murphy M3 (S3, UC8253 + touch + frontlight) |
| `-DFREEINK_DEVICE_LILYGO` | LilyGo T5 S3 (S3, ED047TC1 raw-parallel EPD via LovyanGFX) |
| *(none)* | **compile error** — a build must select at least one device |

Multiple **different-pinout** devices on one MCU are runtime-selected: `ACTIVE`
defaults to a compile-time default and the consumer calls
`BoardConfig::selectDevice(...)` after its own detection (the SDK doesn't ship a
detector; X3/X4 detection stays in the consumer, e.g. CrossPoint's fingerprint).

**Capabilities** (`-DFREEINK_CAP_<NAME>`) gate feature *code* to keep binaries
tight. Each defaults on when an included device needs it; force with `=0`/`=1`:

| Flag | Gates | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `FREEINK_CAP_TOUCH` | capacitive touch decoder (InputManager) | on if a device has touch |
| `FREEINK_CAP_FRONTLIGHT` | PWM frontlight (FrontlightManager) | on if a device has a frontlight |
| `FREEINK_CAP_COLOR` | color panel code | on for M5 |
| `FREEINK_CAP_AUDIO` | audio output (scaffold) | off |
| `FREEINK_CAP_NET_TLS13` | wolfSSL TLS 1.3 (≡ `FREEINK_NET_WOLFSSL`) | off |

**Other flags:**

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-DFREEINK_DISPLAY_FLIPPED` (or `-DFLIPPED`) | back-compat alias for `BoardProfile.orientation = MIRROR_Y` on SSD1677 |
| `-DFREEINK_SD_SDMMC=1` | use the native 4-bit SDMMC backend (needs `-DUSE_BLOCK_DEVICE_INTERFACE=1`); auto-on for de-link |
| `-DFREEINK_BATTERY_I2C_GAUGE=1` | compile the I²C fuel-gauge backend (BQ27220/BQ25896); auto-on for X3 and LilyGo. Gauge-vs-ADC is then runtime per profile, so X3 (gauge) + X4 (ADC) coexist in one binary |
| `-DEINK_DISPLAY_SINGLE_BUFFER_MODE=1` | single framebuffer (uses controller RAM as previous frame) |
| `-DFREEINK_NET_WOLFSSL=1` | enable the wolfSSL TLS 1.3 transport in `SecureNet` |

Panel **orientation/mirroring** is per-board data, not a flag: set `BoardProfile.orientation`
(`NO_FLIP`, `MIRROR_X`, `MIRROR_Y`, or `ROTATE_180`). The SSD1677 driver applies it in
hardware (mirrorX via RAM column addressing, mirrorY via gate scan). 90° and 270°
need a software transpose, which the driver does not do.

## Networking — TLS 1.3 (`SecureNet`)

The precompiled mbedTLS in the ESP-IDF/pioarduino package ships TLS 1.3 as empty
stubs, so `WiFiClientSecure` / `esp_http_client` cannot reach TLS-1.3-only servers
(e.g. KOSync at `kosync.ak-team.com:3042` — handshake fails with `-0x7780`). A
`-D` flag can't change a precompiled `.a`, and a from-source ESP-IDF rebuild is a
heavier path. `SecureNet` brings its own TLS stack — **wolfSSL compiled from
source** — which supports TLS 1.3 + PSA and bypasses system mbedTLS entirely:

- `freeink::SecureClient` — an Arduino `Client` doing TLS 1.3 over `WiFiClient`.
- `freeink::SecureHttpClient` — an `HTTPClient`-compatible shim so existing call
  sites switch with minimal churn.

Opt-in: `-DFREEINK_NET_WOLFSSL=1` plus a wolfSSL source `lib_dep`. With the flag
off it compiles to an inert no-op, so the rest of the SDK builds without wolfSSL.

## Using FreeInk from PlatformIO

See **[`platformio.sample.ini`](platformio.sample.ini)** for a complete, ready-to-copy
configuration — it mirrors the toolchain/flags verified against the CrossPoint
firmware and includes per-device build envs (`xteink`, `xteink_x4`, `m5paper`,
`delink`, `murphy`) wired with the right `FREEINK_DEVICE_*` flags.

Already on CrossPoint? **[`platformio.crosspoint.sample.ini`](platformio.crosspoint.sample.ini)**
mirrors the exact working setup: drop it into the CrossPoint repo as
`platformio.local.ini`, point the paths at your FreeInk SDK checkout, and
`pio run -e default` builds the X3+X4 C3 binary against this SDK with **no source
changes** (the compat shim preserves every include path and class name).

The minimum is to add the libraries you need as symlink `lib_deps` (names match
the original SDK):

```ini
lib_deps =
  BoardConfig=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/BoardConfig
  EInkDisplay=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/display/FreeInkDisplay
  InputManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/InputManager
  BatteryMonitor=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/BatteryMonitor
  SDCardManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/SDCardManager
  ; optional:
  PowerManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/PowerManager
  FrontlightManager=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/FrontlightManager
  SecureNet=symlink://path/to/freeink-sdk/libs/network/SecureNet
```

`#include <EInkDisplay.h>` and the `EInkDisplay` type keep working via the compat
shim. The display libs depend on `BoardConfig`; `SdFat` is pulled in
automatically as a dependency of `SDCardManager`.

## Adding a new device

1. Add a `BoardProfile` to `BoardConfig.h` (pins, geometry, controller, input
   style, optional touch/frontlight/audio) and a `FREEINK_DEVICE_*` flag + a
   `selectDevice` case that points `ACTIVE` at it.
2. If it uses an existing controller, reuse that driver — inject a tuned **config
   struct** (its own LUTs/waveforms) without editing the driver: define
   `const Uc8253X3Config& yourConfig();` (or `Ssd1677Config`) in `namespace
   freeink` and build with `-DFREEINK_UC8253_X3_CONFIG=yourConfig` (or
   `-DFREEINK_SSD1677_CONFIG=...`). If it's a new controller, add a `PanelDriver`
   in its own file + `FREEINK_DRIVER_*` flag.

   **Resolution is always a `BoardProfile` field** — `displayWidth/Height`. Every
   driver reads its geometry from the active profile (and `getDisplayWidth()/
   Height()` pass it to firmware); no driver special-cases its own size. The
   config struct is purely waveforms/LUTs. These are orthogonal: a different-size
   UC8253 panel sets its size in its profile and its waveforms in a config.
3. **Each device gets its own profile, `FREEINK_DEVICE_*` flag, and build env.** Two devices
   may share one binary when they're distinguishable at runtime — that is how
   Xteink X3 and X4 ride one ESP32-C3 env: **two full profiles** (`XTEINK_X4`
   800×480/SSD1677 and `XTEINK_X3` 792×528/UC8253) compile into the same bin, and
   `setDisplayX3()` swaps the active profile + driver after I2C fingerprinting.
   They happen to share a pinout, but each is a real profile — not one profile
   doing double duty. Same MCU but different GPIOs, screen, or controller ⇒ a
   separate profile and a separate env, never an auto-shared bin.

### Devices backed by external libraries

A `PanelDriver` doesn't have to emit raw SPI — it can wrap a third-party display
library. Some panels need this: a raw-parallel EPD with no on-glass controller
(e.g. the LilyGo T5 S3's ED047TC1) is driven by **LovyanGFX's `Panel_EPD`**
(bundled in `m5stack/M5GFX`). FreeInk ships exactly that as **`LgfxEpdDriver`**
(`usesExternalBus()`), and the M5 PaperColor's optional `M5OfficialDriver` wraps
M5GFX the same way. FreeInk pulls these libraries in **per device**, so builds
that don't use them stay lean:

1. Put the external `#include` and the driver code **inside the driver's
   `#if FREEINK_DRIVER_<NAME>` guard** (the flag the registry derives from the
   device — e.g. `FREEINK_DRIVER_LGFX_EPD`). PlatformIO's LDF (chain mode) only
   links the external library when that driver actually compiles, so other
   devices are unaffected.
2. Add the external library to **that device's env `lib_deps`** in your
   `platformio.ini` (see `platformio.sample.ini`). It's installed for that env
   only.
3. Implement the device's `PanelDriver` as a thin wrapper over the library's API
   (init/draw/refresh/sleep), exactly like the native drivers — the facade can't
   tell the difference.

This keeps the SDK's display surface uniform (`EInkDisplay` everywhere) while
letting each device bring whatever rendering stack it needs. The LilyGo T5 S3 is
the worked example — see
[`docs/lilygo-t5s3-support.md`](docs/lilygo-t5s3-support.md) for its bring-up
(board-injected `LgfxEpdConfig` + power hooks) and the remaining board-support
gaps (I²C battery gauge, expander button).

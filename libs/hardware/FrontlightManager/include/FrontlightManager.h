// FreeInk SDK — frontlight manager.
//
// Drives a PWM frontlight described by BoardConfig::ACTIVE.frontlight. Inert on
// boards without one (e.g. Xteink X4/X3), so it is always safe to construct.
//
// Scope: the single brightness-PWM path is functional now (used by the de-link
// board's primary LED). Tunable warm/cool color mixing and the boost-driver
// fault/OVP sensing (de-link's GPIO6/7/17/18) are scaffolded as no-op hooks for
// a follow-up.
